<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray FPD Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-ray Flat Panel Detector (FPD) market is divided into two main types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion FPDs utilize a scintillator to convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then detected by a sensor, offering high sensitivity and image quality. In contrast, direct conversion FPDs directly convert X-ray photons into electric signals without the intermediate step, resulting in faster imaging and improved spatial resolution. Both types play crucial roles in modern radiography, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.</p></p>
